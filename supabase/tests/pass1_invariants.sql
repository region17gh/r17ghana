-- Region 17 — member register invariant harness
--
-- Run this after EVERY migration that touches the member tables, their
-- policies, or their triggers. It is not a pass 1 artifact; it is the
-- regression suite for the register.
--
-- How to run: paste the whole file into the SQL editor, or run it through the
-- run_sql tool as a single statement.
--
-- Safety: the whole harness runs inside one function call that ALWAYS raises
-- at the end, so PostgreSQL rolls the transaction back. Nothing it writes
-- survives, including member numbers. The results are smuggled out in the
-- exception message. A register whose entire value is accuracy must not carry
-- test rows.
--
-- Role discipline: FIXTURES (state that merely has to exist) are written as
-- service_role, matching how they're actually created in production --
-- reserve_member_number() and register_member() are both SECURITY DEFINER
-- running as service_role internally. The one exception is a fixture or read
-- that touches something service_role genuinely cannot reach on production:
-- auth.users, which GoTrue owns and reaches as supabase_auth_admin (section
-- 11b), and member_gender, whose SELECT was deliberately revoked from
-- service_role (section 12c). Those use RESET ROLE to drop to the connecting
-- role instead. Never widen a production grant to make a case run.
-- ASSERTIONS (the thing each case is testing) run as authenticated, because a
-- check performed by an elevated role proves nothing about what a signed-in
-- member can actually do. A connection with BYPASSRLS or superuser sails past
-- RLS regardless of what role the harness claims to switch to, which is how
-- this harness ran for its entire history before it started connecting
-- through a path that enforces RLS for real: two real bugs (an RLS gap on
-- number_reservations exposure, and enforce_member_rules() not being
-- SECURITY DEFINER) were passing silently the whole time, because nothing
-- had ever exercised authenticated's actual privileges. Every role switch
-- below is commented with which of the two it is and why.
--
-- Adding a case: append to the `check` calls below. The known invariant
-- collision this harness caught (erasure clearing the handle tripping the
-- once-only handle rule) is exactly the class of bug that reappears whenever
-- a new rule is added, so err towards adding cases for rule interactions,
-- not just rules.
--
-- A recurring bug shape, named here because it has hit this file four times
-- and will hit it again: an assertion that passes or fails for a reason
-- other than the thing under test. Section 1 originally paired the JWT claim
-- and the role switch in one BEGIN block, so a refused role switch silently
-- reverted the JWT claim too, and every case below it passed for "not signed
-- in" instead of the reservation rule it existed to prove. Section 7 checked
-- member B's row while still claiming to be member A, so the RLS-scoped
-- UPDATE matched zero rows and reported a false FAIL instead of exercising
-- the immutability trigger. Sections 8 and 9 treated "no exception raised"
-- as proof a write was refused, but a zero-row UPDATE or DELETE succeeds
-- trivially in Postgres -- it doesn't raise -- so both looked identical
-- whether the write was genuinely blocked or the row was simply invisible
-- under RLS. Different mechanisms, same shape: check the actual outcome
-- (the row's state, who's really signed in, which role really executed),
-- never just the absence of an error. The next case written here will reach
-- for the same shortcut unless this is read first.
--
-- Fourth instance, caught on production rather than in review: the
-- information_schema.*_privileges views (role_table_grants,
-- routine_privileges, column_privileges) only show grants visible to the
-- currently active role. A case that impersonates authenticated and then
-- queries one of those views for a grant made to anon or service_role gets
-- back zero rows unconditionally -- not because the grant doesn't exist, but
-- because the view can't see another role's grants from here. That reads as
-- PASS ("no such grant") regardless of the true state, which is exactly
-- backwards from a check whose job is to catch an over-broad grant. This hit
-- the activate_membership EXECUTE check (coincidentally correct: anon truly
-- had no grant) and sections 14/14b on member_gender (not coincidental:
-- production had SELECT held by both anon and service_role, masked as PASS).
-- has_table_privilege() / has_function_privilege() / has_column_privilege()
-- take an explicit role argument and are not scoped to the active role --
-- use those for any assertion about a role other than the one currently
-- impersonated. pg_policies and pg_class are catalog views, not
-- information_schema privilege views, and are not subject to this
-- restriction; checks that read those are unaffected.

  -- 11b. Activation depends on a confirmation GoTrue actually issued ---------

  -- exactly the vulnerability this migration closes. Only the
  -- activate_membership() calls run as authenticated, because that is the one
  -- surface a real signed-in member actually reaches.
  --
  -- The auth.users fixtures and reads are the exception, and they use RESET
  -- ROLE rather than service_role, for the same reason section 12c does.
  -- service_role has no table access to auth.users on production: GoTrue owns
  -- that schema outright and connects as supabase_auth_admin, a role entirely
  -- separate from what PostgREST/service_role reaches. Written as
  -- service_role, the INSERT below raises "permission denied for table users"
  -- there, the EXCEPTION handler at the end of this block swallows it, and all
  -- seven activation assertions -- unconfirmed refused, record left pending,
  -- wrong-address refused, confirmed address activates, email_verified_at
  -- sourced from GoTrue not the caller, double-activation is a no-op,
  -- suspended can't self-activate -- silently degrade to one skipped line.
  -- That went unnoticed for as long as it did precisely because local and
  -- preview DO give service_role auth.users, so the block ran everywhere it
  -- was looked at and only skipped where it mattered.

  -- cannot erase it -- the erasure would report success and leave the gender
  -- record standing. Withholding SELECT is what condition 4 asks for; the
  -- write grants are what makes erasure work.
  --
  -- So this case checks SELECT specifically, not any privilege. It previously
  -- counted ANY grant, which made it stricter than the invariant it exists to

  -- service_role (service_role also carries BYPASSRLS, so RLS was not a

  -- 17. D-078 reserved-slug guard --------------------------------------------

  -- plus its completions migration 20260902204231, both already applied to
  -- production. This is the regression guard going forward.
  --
  -- Three changes were made to the handed-over section, each because the
  -- assertion as written did not test the thing it named. All three are the
  -- recurring bug shape this file's header describes, and this is the fifth
  -- instance:
  --
  --   a. It lived in standalone `do $$` blocks appended after
  --      `SELECT pg_temp.run_register_invariants();`. CI runs this file with
  --      `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1`, and that SELECT always ends in a RAISE, so psql
  --      stops there. Anything below it never executes. Twelve assertions
  --      would have reported nothing while the build went green. Folded into
  --      the harness function instead, ahead of the closing RAISE, which also
  --      makes their results count: the workflow's verdict is a grep for
  --      PASS and FAIL lines against a pinned EXPECTED_PASS, and a
  --      `raise notice` line matches neither.
  --
  --   b. D078.3 and D078.4 omitted `places.name`, which is NOT NULL with no
  --      default. PostgreSQL checks NOT NULL before CHECK, so both inserts
  --      raised 23502 and never reached the slug constraints they exist to
  --      prove. Confirmed by probe against production on 2026-09-02:
  --      sqlstate 23502 without `name`, 23514 with it. Worse than a false
  --      pass, `when check_violation` does not catch 23502, so both would
  --      have aborted the whole run. `name` is now supplied.
  --
  --   c. D078.9, D078.10 and D078.11 ran under whatever role was current.
  --      `places` has RLS with a single `places_select_published` SELECT
  --      policy, and exactly one row is unpublished: `agotime`, at
  --      `traditional/agotime`. That row is the only reason the synthetic
  --      root `traditional` exists, so D078.11 -- the assertion written
  --      specifically to catch an unreserved synthetic root -- could not see
  --      the case it was built for and would have passed vacuously forever.
  --      All three now run as service_role, and that is the point of them.
